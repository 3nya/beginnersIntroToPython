# Beginners Introduction To Python
## A simple, comprehensive book for younger students interested in learning **Python**. Created by members of **Herricks Coding Club** in 2023!

We are currently working on a easy way for readers to test their own code in our exercises alongside reading the book. This project is a WIP, but you can read the completed book so far here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZsFsT2kp32G5WcGesj-G8QCuDozIcn0cB11L3AKL0A/edit?usp=sharing.
